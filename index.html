        <h1>Serena Aranas</h1>
        <h2>UI/UX Designer + Front-end Developer</h2>
        <p>I am a web and media designer who brings together both creative and technical skills. I've always enjoyed doing art and in the process of learning to make video games, I found use for those skills in web development.</p>
        <p>I'm an IT professional with a proven track record of success, bringing 6 years of marketing, design, and development experience working closely with both clients and senior management.</p>
        <p>I'm currently on my 6th year working as a front end developer and technology specialist for a travel, meetings and hospitality industry company but in my spare time, I enjoy playing video games (FFXIV players hit me up! Also currently playing Xenoblade Chronicles 3.),
        watching anime, cosplaying at conventions, and traveling on food trips to try new cuisines and experiences.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
        <p>- Serena</p>
